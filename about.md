title: About me
---

I'm working since mid 90's as a software developer, consultant and architect.
Starting my career at the Institute of Mammalian Genetics near Munich being part
of the Human Genome Project, I had the opportunity to create an animal
management system together with an international team of scientists. Getting
started with Business and IT Consulting at Metafinanz in Munich, I learned much
more about professional software development in different scenarios. Touching
the world of Start-Ups like BlueOrbit and Curry Communications could have been a
longer experience - check. As a Senior IT Consultant at evodion IT I could
greatly expand my skills. Today, I'm an experienced Senior Software Developer
and Architect and specialized in IT related topics around investigative
journalism. Employee since 2004 in the SPIEGEL-Group located in Hamburg.
